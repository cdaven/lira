# Lira

Lira indexed and organized all your MP3 songs, and you could play them through Winamp.

This was my contribution to Datormagazin's big programming competition in 2003 ("Datormagazins Stora Programmeringst√§vling 2003"). The winners were revealed in magazine #2, 2004. (I did not get any kind of prize or honorary mention.)

I started working on this just days after Apple released iTunes for Windows on October 16, 2003. You could say this is my iTunes clone.

Lira was built using Borland C++Builder, and I have no idea how to compile it nowadays.

This was not my first C++ project, but as it happened, it would be my last (as of 2023).

## Design Overview

(Writing this was a "the journey is the reward" kind of project. I spent a lot of time learning to apply OO principles and patterns to really understand them, and most of it was unnecessary.
But I have always struggled with writing just-good-enough code to get it over with. If I'm not learning anything, I probably won't like it.)

[guimain.cpp](https://github.com/cdaven/lira/blob/main/gui/guimain.cpp) is where the main application form is created, and also where I initialize the [Mediator](https://github.com/cdaven/lira/blob/main/Mediator.cpp) object,
that is used for communication between objects without tight coupling (see [Mediator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern)).

It would seem I store the index of all MP3 songs in [a flat-file database](https://github.com/cdaven/lira/blob/main/database/ConcreteDatabaseEngine.cpp).

## Acknowledgements

Some of my fellow students at KTH at the time helped me in some way, but I currently fail to remember how (sorry!): Jacek Sieka, Hjalmar Olsson, Charlie Hansson.

And I have to mention the Usenet thread in `comp.object` where I got two replies from Uncle Bob: https://groups.google.com/g/comp.object/c/PMfdt1xoB-g/m/eb-e4kRD12AJ (June 28, 2003).
