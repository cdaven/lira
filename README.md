# Lira

Lira indexed and organized all your MP3 songs, and you could play them through Winamp.

This was my contribution to Datormagazin's big programming competition in 2003 ("Datormagazins Stora Programmeringst√§vling 2003"). The winners were revealed in magazine #2, 2004. (I did not get any kind of prize or honorary mention.)

I started working on this just days after Apple released iTunes for Windows on October 16, 2003. You could say this is my iTunes clone.

Lira was built using Borland C++Builder, and I have no idea how to compile it nowadays.

This was not my first C++ project, but as it happened, it would be my last (as of 2023).

## Design Overview

[guimain.cpp](https://github.com/cdaven/lira/blob/main/gui/guimain.cpp) is where the main application form is created, and also where I initialize the [Mediator](https://github.com/cdaven/lira/blob/main/Mediator.cpp) object,
that is used for communication between objects without tight coupling (see [Mediator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern)).

It would seem I store the index of all MP3 songs in [a flat-file database](https://github.com/cdaven/lira/blob/main/database/ConcreteDatabaseEngine.cpp).
